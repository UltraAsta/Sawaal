The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean on Earth, covering more than 63 million square miles and containing over half of the planet’s open water. It stretches from the Arctic in the north to Antarctica in the south, bordered by Asia and Australia on the west and the Americas on the east. The ocean hosts the Mariana Trench, the deepest natural point on the planet, reaching nearly 36,000 feet below sea level. Its vast size influences global weather patterns, ocean currents, and climate systems, making it a central component of Earth’s environmental stability.
